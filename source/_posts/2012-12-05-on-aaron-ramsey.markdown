Aaron Ramsey is Responsible for the Holocaust
==============

If you have paid any attention to Arsenal FC lately, it's fairly evident that the apocalypse is imminent, and Aaron Ramsey is the singular harbinger of doom. The most condescendingly critical dismiss his [statistical accomplishments](https://twitter.com/Orbinho/status/180349391515824129) as a fluke, and at home games, he's booed as if he played for Spurs.

It's not that "statistically" Ramsey is one of the best players on the squad (which he is, but Opta's definition of 'chances created' is a little lenient), but that he is 100% one of the best technical players left in our midfield. The problem is that a tactical shift + the inability of our forward line to create passing triangles makes him positionally liable for breakdowns in attacks and losses of possession. 

Consider some examples:
-------------

1. **2010-2011:**
 
	nasri      | rvp   | Theo
	------     |------ |-----
    Wilshere   | Cesc  | song

	Since Wilshere pushed up in possession, and song covered, there was a constant rotating triangle between Cesc/nasri/Wilshere or Cesc/rvp/nasri. This was because nasri often cut in, which he then got slagged off for later in the season (blah blah blah, not trying to beat markers, etc), but opens up space when he draws the right CB and the right back for clichy and RVP to exploit, and gives Cesc short passing options at any given time to prevent the double/triple press.
2. **2011-2012 (first half, a [good Ramsey game](http://www.zonalmarking.net/2011/10/29/chelsea-3-5-arsenal-chelseas-high-line-ripped-to-shreds-in-amazingly-open-game/))**

	Arsenal face a team trying to play a high line + press. Ramsey plays box to box in the center of the pitch, fat frank has no desire to track back, mikel has to drop back to pick up RVP, leaving Arteta/Ramsey against Ramires. KEY: we play 2 "strikers" on the wings, which forces ca$hley and bosingwa to either sit back or try to bomb forward in possession. In either case, this leaves a ton of lateral space to Ramsey to drop into and do what he does best - pick up the ball from a sideways layoff (Arteta mostly) and then play a through ball to someone making a run behind the defense. When Ramsey drops wide, Obi Mikel doesn't know what do with himself.

3. **2011-2012 (example game #2 - a [bad Ramsey game](http://www.zonalmarking.net/2012/01/15/swansea-3-2-arsenal-swansea-outpass-arsenal/))**

	Ramsey plays that back-two, distribution role. All of Swansea's 3 are ball playing midfielders, and are content to ping it around and keep a steady possession flow. Since Arsenal > Swansea, Arsenal want to get the ball back and keep it, but Arsha + Walcott stay high up the pitch, so Ramsey + Benayoun are forced into a 2v3 press, which for obvious reasons doesn't work at all. Furthermore, every time the double pivot tries to run after the ball when the swansea MF passes to the LB, he gets drawn out of position and leaves a huge 3v2 in the midfield. This allows one of two things:

	1. an unprotected diagonal pass from allen to sinclair, who smartly drops back into "low danger" zones, so isn't being marked tightly by djourou, but then can run straight at the defense
	2. Ramsey somehow gets the ball, because swansea's mf isn't that good, and has exactly two passes: a long distance backpass to Song, and a shorter one to Theo, who is hanging out around the byline right next his marking fullback. Of course, then Theo has exactly one pass (back to Ramsey), and after a few exchanges (if that), one of them loses the ball, and triggers a left sided counterattack (this game is a particularly good example, because with Arsenal's right back problems last year, there was always 0 attacking + high press help from the RB, even if they didn't look horrible defensively)

4. **2012-2013 (Ramsey playing on the wing, [ineffective game](http://www.zonalmarking.net/2012/11/03/manchester-united-2-1-arsenal-united-attack-down-the-right/))**

	This is a horrible setup for so many reasons. Young stays relatively deep, as United wingers are instructed to do, so Ramsey is 2v1 on the wing, with exactly one passing outlet (cazorla center), since Giroud is playing off the CB to offer a clearance outlet. Ramsey is effectively given a triple-mandate: cover the right wing, offer a counterattacking threat (which again, requires beating 2 markers + a covering CB), and drop into midfield to try and reclaim possession (again, impossible, because it's mutually exclusive with the first one). Furthermore, when United realize that valencia + rafael are being given a 2v1 on Santos, they can sacrifice Young to pin Ramsey on the right side, meaning that Ramsey is almost guaranteed to lose the ball every time it's cleared to him from one of the defenders (because how hard is it to cut off angles to Giroud and Cazorla when there are literally 4 defenders in that zone). It's a weird defensive move that counterintuitively concedes the tempo + tactical advantage to the opponent. Similarly, when he's been played on the wing in games that we're supposed to win, he drops into MF and doesn't really have a threat of running past his FB, so there's no real need for the defense to break their shape - MAYBE BECAUSE HE ISN'T A WINGER.

5. **Sunderland 2-0 Arsenal, 2011 (Ramsey playing central attacking mid, [bad game](http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/match/2012/feb/18/sunderland-v-arsenal))**

	Ox stays wide, Theo stays wide, RVP is double/triple/whatever marked. Sunderland are a very disciplined side, so their wingers stay deep, blocking off the lateral space, and neither of the lateral zones are available for the central playmaker to drop into. Sunderland are content to let Arteta-Song-Ramsey have a sideways pass circle-jerk with the defense, but there's zero passing options if the 3 push up - everyone knows they're going to pass to RVP - the wingers never cut in. This means that the person in charge of making passes to RVP (Ramsey) is almost always going to lose the ball, or get boxed out, losing the backwards option.

Takeaways
---------
Aaron Ramsey (and literally EVERY other pseudo-human playmaker) CANNOT function in a constant 2v1 situation, because their entire job is to hop into pockets of space and either play 1-2s or switch play to a different open zone when the defenders try and press them. I think what distinguishes Rosicky/Cazorla isn't technical ability but rather the fact that they are seasoned professionals that are able to choose their runs such that they force/direct movement in the forward line, but as recent results have shown, that doesn't always work (and rosicky relied on RVP's excellent movement at the back half of last season). It shouldn't be Ramsey's role to coordinate the movement of all 3 forwards - it's something that they need to work on and coordinate together.

Solutions
---------

You have 3 real options to move forward given our personnel.

1. Introduce a REAL wide playmaker that becomes an auxiliary midfielder, but can also make runs behind, and have the forward drop back and contribute to buildup play. This doesn't mean lumping forward to Giroud, it means someone who rotates with the #10 and can control the tempo from the front to force CBs to step out. The most important thing here is to speed up our passing tempo, which (for reasons I stated above), mostly involves disciplined movement and constant rotation off the ball.

2. Introduce a second forward, and drop the #10 position. People keep calling for a 4-4-2, but this is much more nuanced than that. I'm not a huge fan of this, for all the common reasons (leaves us exposed in european play, doesn't let us necessarily control the tempo), but it's better than what we have now. Ramsey can play in one of the CM roles, but I would argue that our best pairing in this case is Arteta-Wilshere for the traditional passer-runner pivot, since 4-4-2 mids are expected to do a lot of defending. In this case, we don't really have wide personnel - Ox is probably the closest to someone who can start from a real wide mid position. Maybe Santos. Neither is particularly good at crossing.

3. Truly become a counterattacking team (a la 05-06 arsenal). This requires a TON of discipline that we haven't shown we're capable of. You probably play Ramsey as the second "striker," and have to drop giroud in favor of a quicker counterattacking threat at forward (like Theo). The key here is staying very compact, and you can't have players that hug the touchline -- even at his finest, Ljungberg would sprint down the wings, but his average crossing position seemed to be the top corner of the box (he also got into central positions to shoot pretty often). THE KEY HERE is exploiting transitions quickly and converging on triangles at the 30 yard box, which is something that Ramsey can be devastatingly effective at. Gervinho, Arteta, not so much.

Summary
---------
Ramsey's inefficiency is a product of a system in flux, and the constant booing will only damage his confidence until he either has no desire to be an arsenal player or loses all desire to be creative, becoming the next denilson. while I understand that it's fun to scapegoat, and it's nice to be holier-than-thou and suggest that a single player is at fault for not winning a trophy for 7 years, one questions the system with 11 intl-capped players unable to beat aston goddamn villa.
